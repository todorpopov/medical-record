# System Tools
This directory hosts a number of Python scripts for automating the building and deploying processes of different parts
of the system. Below is the documentation of how to use the scripts, as well as what parameters do they expect, and what
behavior to expect.

## Script - `build_jar_files.py`
This script is used to build the jar files for the different Maven submodules.

To use the script, you need to have Python 3, Maven and a JDK (the project was build using JDK23, however, different
versions have not been tested and may work as well) installed and added to your `PATH`.

Run the script using the following command from the project root:
  - `python3 build/build_jar_files.py --modules 'specific modules separated by a single space'`
  - `python3 build/build_jar_files.py --modules auth appointments diagnoses`

The script has an optional `--modules` parameter. When it is not passed, the script will build all submodules one after
the other. To specify the submodules you want to build, you need to pass them like this `--modules users api auth`.
Modules need to be separated by a single space for the script to be able to recognize them.

The available modules are:
  - `api`
  - `appointments`
  - `auth`
  - `diagnoses`
  - `users`

Passing incorrect modules will result in 0 build modules!

Passing a combination of correct and incorrect modules will result in building only the correct ones!

The module names are directly correlated to the module directory, so renaming the submodule directories will render this
script unusable!

## Script - `build_docker_images.py`
This script is very similar to the `build_jar_files.py` script in terms of use. To run the script you need to enter the
following command from project root:
  - `python3 build/build_docker_images.py --modules 'specific modules separated by a single space'`
  - `python3 build/build_docker_images.py --modules api frontend users`

Just like the `build_jar_files.py` script, this one has an optional `--modules` parameter. When not specified, the
script will build all submodule Dockerfiles.

The available modules are:
  - `api`
  - `appointments`
  - `auth`
  - `diagnoses`
  - `users`
  - `frontend`
